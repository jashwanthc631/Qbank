CHAPTER 1 
Topic :- Introduction of Software Testing 


Manul Testing also called it as Functional QA

Roles and responcibilities of Functional QA

1. Understanding the application requirements 
2. Understanding the RTM Document 
3. Identifying scenerious 
4. Understanding the Test plan Document 
5. Desining Test Cases 
6. Involivng in test case review 
7. Prepare Test data  
8. Involving in test case execution 
9. Involving in defect tracking and Reporting 
10. Involving in sanity , Functional , Re testing , regression , Somke and UAT.
11. Prepare Status Report 
12. Communicating with Clients and team 

What is Software Testing 

b4 that What is Software ?

Software is the collection of computer programming which is developed for a Specific Requirements 

IN Software We have 3 types 

* Application Software 
* Product Software 
* System Software 

Application Software :- It is the type of Software which is developed for a specific customre .

Product Software :- It is the type of software which is developed for a Multiple Customer .

System Software :- It is the type of the Software which is developed for a computer Hardware .

Types of application and product Software :-

* Windows Software 
* Web-Application Software 

Windows Software :- The Software which are Installing in computer and Using .

Web-applications Software :- The software Accessing through browser .


Now Whats is Software Testing ?

I can give an multiple definations about the software Testing 

* Softeware Testing is an Activity to test the customers ecpected requirements are matching with the developed software or not .
* Softeware Testing is the process of Identifying the Correctness, Completeness and Quality of the Software .
* Software Testing is the process Improving the Quality of the software 
* Software Testing is the Process of Identifying the Quality of the Software .

Completness :- Whether develpoed Software is developed fro all the requirements or not 
Correctness :- Whether it is working properly or not 
Quality :- Nothing but the Satisfection 


What is Quality ?

Qualtiy is the customer Satisfection 

when we call as the Software is the Quality Software ?

* Software Should be Bug Free ( without Any Error )
* Software Should be Completed with in the time Frame 
* Software Should Be completed Wiht in the Budget 

Importance of the Software Testing 

* To Identify Defect 
* To Avoid End User Detecting Promblem 
* To Prove that Software has no foults 
* To Prove That the software is working as per the customers requirements
* To stay in business .

What is ERROR , DEFECT , BUG , FAILURE ?

* Error's are found by the developer while Executing the programm 
* Defect's are found by the Testers While Testing process 
* Bug are found by the UAT team It is the mis-matching b/w the Expected and Actula result .
* Failures :- It is the mis-matching b/w the Expected and Actula this are found by the End Users in a real time scenarioes .





CHAPTER 2
Topic :- SDLC-Software Development Life Cycle

Software Development Life Cycle It is used in Software Industry to Design , Dvelopment and to test the Quality of the Software .

With Some Phases :- 

* Initial / Requirement Phase
* Analysis Phase 
* Designing Phase 
* Development Phase 
* Testing Phase 
* Delevery And Maintain Phase .

SDLC Aim to produce the hight Quality of the software with customers   

:- AGAIL PROCESS :- 

Agail model is an increment and itirative process of the Software development .

Customer Requirement's is 1000 

if the 1000 User Stories 

Then in Agail model we do it as 3 release 

R1 :- 300 
      C1:-100 we do FT =100 reg 
      C2:-100 we do FT =200 reg 
      C3:-100 we do FT =300 reg 

R2 :- 300
      C1:-100 we do FT =400 reg 
      C2:-100 we do FT =500 reg 
      C3:-100 we do FT =600 reg 
      
R3 :- 400 
      C1:-100 we do FT =700 reg 
      C2:-100 we do FT =800 reg 
      C3:-200 we do FT =1000 reg 
                                   This is how the Agail model will work 

 #. Scrum Methadology is used fro managing the agail project 

And we will have the Scrum Team 

We can Name our self for our Scrum Team :- 

In this :- 
* Product Owner will involve daily 
* Scrum Master will involve ( Team Lead )
* Developer 
* Tester 

What is Sprint :- Sprint is the fixed lenght development period with a clear goal .

:- In Scrum There are Three Types of Backlogs are there to plan and manage the Agail Project 
   They are :-

 * Sprint Backlog 
 * Release Backlog 
 * Product Backlog 

What is Sprint Backlog ?
:- It is the fixed lenght development period with clear goal is called Sprint Backlog .

What is Release Backlog ?
:- It is the combinations of the 3 cycles and releasing as one release called the release backlog .

What is the Product Backlog ?
:- While developing process if any new ideas are come from the Product owner , Developer , Scrum Master or Tester is called the Product Backlog .


--> And Productivity in Agail Process is 6-Hours and rest 2-Hours from the Scrum Meeting 

In Scrum Meeting We have to Discuss only :-

* What i have completed from the last Sprint .
* What i have planned from currnet Sprint to next Sprint.
* Do i have Any Road Block's ( This things to be Discuss in Scrum Meeting ) .


Sprint Planning :- Sprint Planning is done by the Scrum Master 
                   * To no the avaliability of the Associatives and to assign the User Stories as per the Requirements.

Sprint Status :- Its nothing but the Burn Down Chart :- To tarck the working hours in Agail process .


What is Agail Retrospective Meeting ?

:- Agail Retrospective Meeting can thought us the learnt lession Meeting 

And here everyone Sholud discuss only :-
      * What Went Well ?
        :- Any RNR's 
      * What not Went Well ?
      * What actions can be taken for taking our process forward .
